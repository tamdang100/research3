# Measuring the Energy-related Uncertainty Index
## <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eneco.2023.106817">Published in Energy Economics</a>

### Brief description
- A novel energy-related uncertainty index (the EUI) is developed.
- The text analysis of the monthly country reports of the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) is applied to construct the EUI.
- The vector autoregression (VAR) model and a range of other estimation methods to evaluate and check the efficacy of the EUI.
- Published in Energy Economics (an **A star-ranked & top field** journal)
- Our index is updated annually via [**Policyuncertainty.com**](https://www.policyuncertainty.com/energy_uncertainty.html)


### Technical skills used in this project
- Utilized **Python** to automatically download a number of monthly country reports for 28 countries over 1996-2022 (**please see the file "automatic_download.ipynb" above**) 
- Employed **Python** to perform the text-searching method to search for the given keywords in the monthly country reports to construct the energy-related uncertainty index for 28 countries over 1996-2022
- Performed several analyses to evaluate the efficacy of the constructed index using **Stata**
